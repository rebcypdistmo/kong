The handbook was originally printed in 2000 and has gone through several updates throughout the years. The most recent update was published in 2019 and features significant changes and improvements. For example, chapter 1 provides an engineering basis for determining pressure drop in single-phase and two-phase flow regimes as well as in wet suction vertical risers, based on current research and analysis via full-scale testing. The chapter also includes new nomographs to aid the user with determining pressure drop in various flow regimes and parameters for determining pressure drop in stainless steel pipe. The chapter also refers the user to several computer programs that can be used to determine pressure drop and assist in selecting pipe sizes based on varying operating and economic conditions.
 
Another notable change in the 2019 update is that some mandatory language has been changed to non-mandatory and a new appendix has been added which addresses piping and equipment identification. The appendix provides guidance on how to label pipes and equipment according to ANSI/IIAR-2 standards and how to use color codes, symbols, abbreviations, and tags to convey important information about the refrigeration system.
 
The handbook also includes electronic documents that provide single and two-phase pipe pressure drop values for vertical suction risers as well as a cost optimization program to aid in economic pipe sizing evaluations. These documents can be accessed by purchasing the handbook from the IIAR website.
 
The IIAR Ammonia Refrigeration Piping Handbook is an essential resource for anyone involved in designing, installing, operating, or maintaining ammonia refrigeration systems. It provides a tutorial and reference book that covers all aspects of refrigeration piping with clarity and accuracy. By following the recommendations and guidelines in the handbook, users can ensure safe, efficient, and reliable operation of their ammonia refrigeration systems.
  
In addition to refrigeration piping, the handbook also covers other components and aspects of ammonia refrigeration systems. For example, chapter 4 discusses condenser piping and explains how to select and size condensers for different applications and operating conditions. The chapter also covers fan alternatives and methods of control, installation considerations, and safety precautions. Chapter 5 covers compressor piping and describes the types and functions of compressors, valves, and accessories. The chapter also provides guidance on how to arrange compressor piping to minimize pressure drop, vibration, and noise.
 
One of the most important topics in ammonia refrigeration is oil removal and return systems, which are covered in chapter 6. The chapter explains the sources and effects of oil in ammonia systems and how to design effective oil separation, recovery, and return systems. The chapter also discusses the types and selection of oil separators, oil pots, oil drains, oil pumps, oil coolers, and oil filters. Chapter 7 covers pressure relief systems and provides information on how to design and install pressure relief devices, piping, headers, manifolds, and vent lines. The chapter also covers the codes and standards that apply to pressure relief systems and how to comply with them.
