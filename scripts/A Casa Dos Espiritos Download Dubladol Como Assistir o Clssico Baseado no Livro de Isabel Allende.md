If you have not read the novel by Isabel Allende, you might be wondering what makes A Casa Dos Espiritos such a classic. The novel is a masterpiece of magical realism, a genre that blends realistic and fantastical elements. The novel explores themes such as love, family, politics, social class, gender, and spirituality. It also depicts the history of Chile from the 1920s to the 1970s, including the rise and fall of Salvador Allende, the author's uncle and the first socialist president of Chile.
  
The movie adaptation, however, fails to capture the essence and depth of the novel. Many critics and fans of the book have pointed out the flaws of the movie, such as the lack of coherence, character development, and emotional impact. The movie also changes some important aspects of the plot and the characters, such as their names, ages, relationships, and motivations. For example, in the movie, Esteban Trueba (Jeremy Irons) is portrayed as a more sympathetic and redeemable character than in the book, where he is a violent and abusive patriarch.
  
In conclusion, A Casa Dos Espiritos is a movie that might appeal to those who enjoy historical dramas and romance, but it does not do justice to the original novel. If you want to experience the full richness and beauty of Isabel Allende's story, we recommend that you read the book instead of or before watching the movie.
