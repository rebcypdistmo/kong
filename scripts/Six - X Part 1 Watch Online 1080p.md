The aborigines in Japan are known as the Ainu, and they are the earliest settlers of Hokkaido, Japan's northern island. They also inhabited parts of Northeast Honshu Island, Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands and the Kamchatka Peninsula before the arrival of the Yamato Japanese and Russians.  The Ainu have a distinct culture, language and physical appearance from the Japanese, and they traditionally practiced hunting, fishing and foraging as their main livelihood. They also had a rich spiritual tradition that revered nature and animals, especially the bear.
 
However, the Ainu have faced a long history of oppression and marginalization by the Japanese government and society, who viewed them as inferior and backward. The Ainu were forced to assimilate into the Japanese culture, adopt Japanese names and religion, pay heavy taxes and tribute, and give up their lands and resources. They were also subjected to discrimination, prejudice and violence from the Japanese settlers who colonized Hokkaido. The Ainu suffered from poverty, disease and loss of identity as a result of these policies.

It was not until 2008 that Japan officially recognized the Ainu as an indigenous people, reversing an 1899 action that had declared them "former Aborigines".  This recognition was seen as a historic step towards restoring the dignity and rights of the Ainu people, who have been struggling to preserve their culture and identity in the face of assimilation and modernization. The Japanese government also pledged to support the Ainu's economic development, education, cultural promotion and land rights. However, many challenges and issues remain unresolved for the Ainu community, such as discrimination, poverty, lack of political representation and environmental degradation.
 
According to official estimates, there are about 25,000 persons of Ainu descent living on Hokkaido in the early 21st century.  However, unofficial estimates place the total population at 200,000 or higher, as many individuals of Ainu descent have no knowledge of their ancestry due to near-total assimilation.  As of 2000, there were about 300 "pure" Ainu left.  In 2008, there were about 100 native Ainu speakers; most of them were elderly.  The Ainu language is considered critically endangered by UNESCO.
 
The Ainu people are now trying to revive their culture and language through various efforts, such as establishing cultural centers, museums, schools and festivals; promoting traditional crafts, music and dance; reclaiming ancestral lands and sacred sites; seeking legal protection and recognition; and engaging in cultural exchange and cooperation with other indigenous peoples around the world. The Ainu hope to pass on their heritage to future generations and to share their unique worldview with the rest of humanity.
