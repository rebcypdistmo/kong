The Holy Quran is the word of God revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) over a period of 23 years. It is the source of guidance, mercy, and wisdom for all Muslims and humanity. The Quran contains 114 chapters (suras) of various lengths and topics, covering various aspects of faith, morality, history, law, and science.
 
However, the Quran is originally in Arabic, a language that is not understood by many people today. Therefore, there is a need for translations and commentaries that can help people access the meaning and message of the Quran in their own languages. One such translation and commentary is Qur Oni Karim Tarjimasi by Alouddin Mansur, a scholar from Uzbekistan.
