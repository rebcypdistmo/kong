Another feature that adds to the challenge and fun of this mod is the infection system. If you are a human and you get bitten by a zombie, you will slowly turn into one of them. You can try to cure yourself with a vaccine or an antidote, but they are rare and expensive. You can also try to resist the infection by killing zombies or staying near your teammates, but it will only delay the inevitable. Once you become a zombie, you will lose your weapons and abilities, and you will have to hunt down the humans.
 
On the other hand, if you are a zombie and you bite a human, you will infect them and turn them into your ally. You can also use your special abilities to help your fellow zombies, such as roaring to attract more zombies, spitting acid to damage humans and their equipment, or jumping on their heads to control them. You can also upgrade your zombie skills by killing humans or completing objectives.
