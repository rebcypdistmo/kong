- DieDesign is the core product that allows you to design and manage a tool structure for dies, gages, and other applications. It has a library of standard catalog components, hundreds of advanced features for designing the tool, automatic drawings, BOM, hole tables, and dimensioning. It also includes the DIE DEBUGGER feature that simulates the die motion and detects interferences dynamically.
- Flatten is a product that allows you to flatten complex 3D parts (surface or solid) and obtain information on thinning, thickening, stress, strain, etc. It also allows you to unbend parts with linear bends, extrusions, flanges, etc.
- ProgSim is an optional product that provides incremental forming simulation for parts not larger than 12 inches/305 mm. It helps you discover formability and springback issues at the strip layout design stage and provides results for thinning, wrinkling, splitting, strain, etc.
- 123GO is a product that helps you record and manage time and tasks in SOLIDWORKS. It tracks your activities automatically and generates reports and charts that can be used for billing, quoting, or project management.
