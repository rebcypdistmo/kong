Berwick Saga is a tactical role-playing game developed by Enterbrain for the PlayStation 2 in 2005. It is the sequel to Tear Ring Saga, a game created by Shouzou Kaga, the original creator of Fire Emblem. Berwick Saga shares many similarities with Fire Emblem, such as turn-based battles on grid maps, permadeath, and character recruitment. However, it also introduces many unique features, such as a free-roaming world map, a day-night cycle, a fatigue system, and a branching storyline.

The patch renders all text into English and fixes some bugs and glitches from the original game.

Berwick Saga takes place on the continent of Lazberia, where two rival factions, the Berwick League and the Raze Empire, have been waging wars for centuries. The game follows the story of Reese, a young knight from the Kingdom of Nalvia, who joins the Verian Mercenaries to fight for the Berwick League. Along the way, he meets various allies and enemies, and gets involved in a complex plot that involves politics, religion, and ancient secrets.
 
The game consists of 15 chapters, each with a main story mission and several side quests. The player can explore the world map between missions and visit different locations, such as towns, castles, and dungeons. The player can also interact with various characters, buy items and equipment, recruit new units, and customize their army. The game has a high degree of freedom and non-linearity, as the player can choose which missions to accept, which characters to use, and which paths to follow.
 
The battles in Berwick Saga are turn-based and take place on grid maps. However, unlike Fire Emblem, the game uses a hexagonal grid instead of a square one, allowing for more movement options and strategic possibilities. The game also has a realistic physics system that affects the accuracy and damage of attacks, depending on factors such as distance, height, terrain, and weather. The game also features a day-night cycle that changes the visibility and behavior of units on the map.
 
Berwick Saga is a challenging game that requires careful planning and execution. The game has permadeath, meaning that units who fall in battle are gone forever. The game also has a fatigue system that limits the number of times a unit can participate in battles before needing to rest. The game also has a branching storyline that changes depending on the player's choices and actions. The game has multiple endings and epilogues for each character, depending on their fate and relationships.
