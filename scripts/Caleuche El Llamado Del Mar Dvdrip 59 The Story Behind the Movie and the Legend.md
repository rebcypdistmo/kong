The film is based on the legend of the Caleuche, a ghost ship that roams the seas of ChiloÃ©, an archipelago off the coast of Chile. The Caleuche is said to be inhabited by the souls of the drowned, who are invited by sirens to join them in a never-ending party. The ship can also change its shape and location at will, and only appears to those who have a special connection with the sea.
 
The protagonist of the film is Isabel Millalobos (ItiÃ©), a marine biologist who suffers from a rare condition that makes her allergic to sunlight. She receives an invitation from her estranged father (Alonso) to visit him on ChiloÃ©, where he claims to have found a cure for her disease. However, when she arrives, she discovers that he has a hidden agenda: he wants to use her as a bait to lure the Caleuche and capture its secrets.
 
Isabel soon finds herself in a dangerous and mystical adventure, where she will have to face her past, her fears and her destiny. She will also meet Daniel (Paxeco), a local fisherman who has a mysterious bond with the sea and the Caleuche. Together, they will try to unravel the mystery of the ghost ship and its connection to Isabel's disease.
